  <p>
    <a href="aboutMyEnglishName.html">Kingsley</a> Lei Shi is a first year graduate student at <a href="http://english.is.cas.cn/" target="_blank">Institute of Software</a>, <a href="http://english.cas.cn/" target="_blank">the Chinese Academy of Sciences(CAS)</a>. Before joining CAS, He got his bachelor degree in computer science from <a href="http://en.whu.edu.cn" target="_blank">Wuhan University</a> in 2012.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    He is working as a research intern (since Apr, 2013) at Knowledge Mining group, <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/labs/asia/" target="_blank">Microsoft Research Aisa</a>, supervised by Dr. Shuming Shi. He also worked as a SDE intern (from Nov, 2011 to Apr, 2012) at Search Technology Center, Microsoft. 
  </p>
  
  <p>CV will be available in a few days.</p>
  <H2>Research Interests</H2>
 His research interests include Data Mining, Machine Learning, Recommender System and Information Extraction. Currently, He focuses on text mining, approximate k-nn Graph construction and tensor factorization.

  <p><b>Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences</b>(Sep,2012-Present, Beijing, China)<BR>
  <I>Research Assitant</I><BR>
  I mainly work on the topic of fast k-NN graph construction. k-NN graphs are widely used in several areas, such as data mining, machine learning and recommender systems. Our goal of this work is to generate k-NN graph with a high precision and reduced time cost.

  <b>Institute of Computer Science, Wuhan University</b>
  (June,2010-June,2012, Wuhan, China)<BR>
  <I>Research Assistant</I><BR>
  I worked with Prof. Wenbin Hu on the topics about self-adaptive and intelligent strategy for yard space plan under uncertainty. I mainly focused on the stowage plan which can be formalized as a combinatorial problem. Container classification algorithm and container stacking strategy are proposed, and group-based encoding genetic algorithm is used to solve this problem.
